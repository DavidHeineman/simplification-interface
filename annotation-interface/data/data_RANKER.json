It is located in the department of Yvelines, in the region of \u00cele-de-France, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) southwest of the centre of Paris.\nA simple hunting lodging and later a small ch\u00e2teau with a moat occupied the site until 1661, when the first work expanding the ch\u00e2teau into a palace was carried out for Louis XIV. In 1682, when the palace had become large enough, the king moved the entire royal court and the French government to Versailles. Some of the palace furniture at this time was constructed of solid silver, but in 1689 much of it was melted down to pay for the cost of war. Subsequent rulers mostly carried out interior remodeling, to meet the demands of changing taste, although Louis XV did install an opera house at the north end of the north wing for the wedding of the Dauphin and Marie Antoinette in 1770. The palace has also been a site of historical importance. The Peace of Paris (1783) was signed at Versailles, the Proclamation of the German Empire occurred in the vaunted Hall of Mirrors, and World War I was ended in the palace with the Treaty of Versailles, among many other events.\nThe palace is now a historical monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, notable especially for the ceremonial Hall of Mirrors, the jewel-like Royal Opera, and the royal apartments; for the more intimate royal residences, the Grand Trianon and Petit Trianon located within the park; the small rustic Hameau (Hamlet) created for Marie Antoinette; and the vast Gardens of Versailles with fountains, canals, and geometric flower beds and groves, laid out by Andr\u00e9 le N\u00f4tre. The Palace was stripped of all its furnishings after the French Revolution, but many pieces have been returned and many of the palace rooms have been restored.\nIn 2017 the Palace of Versailles received 7,700,000 visitors, making it the second-most visited monument in the \u00cele-de-France region, just behind the Louvre and ahead of the Eiffel Tower.\nHistory \nThe hunting lodge and

they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options.\" \u2014Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy\nAfter completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[232] Jolie further wrote, \"On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.\"\nJolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing. Her decision was met with praise from various public figures, while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women. Dubbed \"The Angelina Effect\" by a Time cover story, Jolie's influence led to a \"global and long-lasting\" increase in BRCA gene testing: the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[240] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[243] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk. In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs, which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[247]", "Large Paragraph Index": 1, "Source": "wikipedia", "Substitutes": [[0, 136, 61, 66, [[56, 66, "a woman"], [56, 66, "women ,"], [56, 66,

addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular \"imperium\" when they crossed the Pomerium \u2013 the sacred boundary of Rome \u2013 and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, when he was in the city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or auctoritas, his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.\nIn addition, the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time, because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the legatus who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus's proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph, a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. Lucius Cornelius Balbus was the last man outside Augustus's family to receive this award, in 19 BC. Tiberius, Augustus's eldest stepson by Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph\u2014for victories in Germania in 7 BC.", "Large Paragraph Index": 1, "Source": "wikipedia",

The film was panned by critics, with The Hollywood Reporter writing that \"the mishmash ends up as a thoroughly unfunny adult cartoon.\" Nevertheless, it was a box office success, garnering over $130 million worldwide. A lukewarm box office reception greeted her next film, the romantic comedy The Switch (2010), in which she starred with Jason Bateman as a 30-something single woman who decides to have a child using a sperm bank. The film's opening weekend drew what The Hollywood Reporter dubbed \"a dispiriting $8.4 million\". The film received generally mixed reviews, with review site Metacritic showing 13 out of 30 critics delivering a positive verdict.\nIn 2010, Aniston was also a guest star on the season two premiere of ABC's sitcom Cougar Town, playing a psychiatrist. Her announcement that she would appear on Cougar Town garnered excitement and was dubbed her return to television. The A.V. Club wrote, \" is a funny bit, and it highlights just how much Jennifer Aniston is built to be a TV star.\"[67] In 2011, she starred opposite Adam Sandler as an office manager posing as the wife of a plastic surgeon in the romantic comedy Just Go with It,[70] and played a sexually aggressive dentist in Horrible Bosses. Just Go with It and Horrible Bosses both made over $100 million in North America and $200 million worldwide.[74]", "Large Paragraph Index": 1, "Source": "wikipedia", "Substitutes": [[0, 131, 17, 19,

A founding member of the G7, the Eurozone and the OECD, it is regarded as one of the world's most industrialised nations and a leading country in world trade and exports.[231] It is a highly developed country, with the world's 8th highest quality of life in 2005 and the 26th Human Development Index. The country is well known for its creative and innovative business, a large and competitive agricultural sector (with the world's largest wine production), and for its influential and high-quality automobile, machinery, food, design and fashion industry.[237]\nItaly is the world's sixth largest manufacturing country, characterised by a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size and many dynamic small and medium-sized enterprises, notoriously clustered in several industrial districts, which are the backbone of the Italian industry. This has produced a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of niche market and luxury products, that if on one side is less capable to compete on the quantity, on the other side is more capable of facing the competition from China and other emerging Asian economies based on lower labour costs, with higher quality products. Italy was the world's 7th largest exporter in 2016. Its closest trade ties are with the other countries of the European Union, with whom it conducts about 59% of its total trade. Its largest EU trade partners, in order of market share, are Germany (12.9%), France (11.4%), and Spain (7.4%).\nThe automotive industry is a significant part of the Italian manufacturing sector, with over 144,000 firms and almost 485,000 employed people in 2015, and a contribution of 8.5% to Italian GDP. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles or FCA is currently the world's seventh-largest auto maker. The country boasts a wide range of acclaimed products, from very compact city cars to luxury supercars such as Maserati, Lamborghini, and Ferrari, which was rated the world's most powerful brand by

Interscope Records. Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan, following Eminem's recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself.\nFeaturing West Coast hip hop, G-funk and horrorcore musical styles, the majority of The Slim Shady LP's lyrical content is written from the perspective of Eminem's alter ego Slim Shady, whom he created on the Slim Shady EP (1997). The Slim Shady LP contains cartoonish depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity, which Eminem referred to as \"made-up tales of trailer-park stuff,\" describing it as horror film-esque, in that it is solely for entertainment value. Although many of the lyrics on the album are considered to be satirical, Eminem also depicts his frustrations of living in poverty.\nThe Slim Shady LP debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, just below TLC's FanMail, and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It received commercial and critical success, with critics praising Eminem for his unique lyrical style, dark humor lyrics, and eccentric personality. The first single, \"My Name Is\", became Eminem's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won Best Rap Album at 2000 Grammy Awards, while \"My Name Is\" won Best Rap Solo Performance. In 2000, The Slim Shady LP was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nWhile The Slim Shady LP's success turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity, he became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on U.S. youth. Despite this, the album's success was vital in breaking the stereotype that \"white people cannot rap\", and has since been included in several publications' lists of the greatest albums of all time.

Similarly, masochistic behavior rooted in depression or a self-defeating personality make-up is pathological.]\nParaphilias, urges and fetishes\nDS: What constitutes a paraphiliac?\nJM: Paraphiliac is a general term for a lot of different sexual deviancies, for example, fetishism, or pedophilia or voyeurism. It's the blurring of what I might do that is a turn-on for me, and what might get me into problems with others. Once you cross that line, it exists as a problem. If I come up to your apartment and peer in your window while you are getting undressed, it's a problem for you and it will end up a problem for me. I will be labeled a voyeur, and therefore it's a problem.\nphoto: David Shankbone It's cross-dressing, but is it a pathology?\nDS: Can a person be a paraphiliac and not have it be a problem?", "Large Paragraph Index": 3, "Source": "wikinews", "Substitutes": []}, {"ID": 17, "Title": "Creator of website satirizing Glenn Beck on winning domain name case", "URL": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Creator_of_website_satirizing_Glenn_Beck_on_winning_domain_name_case", "Text": "((WN )) Why did you decide to create the website \"www.glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com\"?\nE-H: There was so much energy in the Fark thread where the meme got its start.

These motions affect the observed disk morphology, its mass accretion rate and variability, and could control the process of planet formation via dust grain concentration, processing and collisional fragmentation. We study gravito-turbulence and the associated spiral structures in thin gaseous disks subject to a prescribed cooling law. We characterize the morphology, coherence and propagation of the spirals, looking out for departures from viscous disk models. We use the finite-volume code Pluto to integrate the equations of self-gravitating hydrodynamics in three-dimensional spherical geometry. The gas is cooled over longer-than-orbital timescales to trigger the gravitational instability and sustain turbulence. We ran models for various disk masses and cooling rates. In all cases considered, the turbulent gravitational stress transports angular momentum outward at a rate compatible with viscous disk theory. The dissipation of orbital energy happens via shocks in spiral density wakes, heating the disk back to a marginally stable thermal equilibrium. These wakes drive vertical motions and contribute to mix material from the disk with its corona. They are formed and destroyed intermittently, and they nearly corotate with the gas at every radius. As a consequence, large-scale spiral arms exhibit no long-term global coherence and energy thermalization is an essentially local process. In the absence of radial substructures or tidal forcing, and provided with a local cooling law, gravito-turbulence reduces to a local phenomenon in thin gaseous disks.", "Large Paragraph Index": 0, "Source": "arxiv", "Substitutes": []}, {"ID": 46, "Title": "Real-time Hall-effect detection of current-induced magnetization dynamics in ferrimagnets", "URL": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00716", "Text": "Measurements of the transverse Hall resistance are widely used to investigate electron transport, magnetization phenomena, and topological quantum states.

We apply this technique to investigate in real-time the magnetization reversal caused by spin-orbit torques in ferrimagnetic GdFeCo dots. Single-shot Hall effect measurements show that the current-induced switching of GdFeCo is widely distributed in time and characterized by significant activation delays, which limit the total switching speed despite the high domain-wall velocity typical of ferrimagnets.

"URL": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00783", "Text": "Iterative Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which resemble unrolled learned iterative schemes have shown to consistently deliver state-of-the-art results for image reconstruction problems across different imaging modalities. However, because these methodes include the forward model in the architecture, their applicability is often restricted to either relatively small reconstruction problems or to problems with operators which are computationally cheap to compute. As a consequence, they have so far not been applied to dynamic non-Cartesian multi-coil reconstruction problems. Methods: In this work, we propose a CNN-architecture for image reconstruction of accelerated 2D radial cine MRI with multiple receiver coils. The network is based on a computationally light CNN-component and a subsequent conjugate gradient (CG) method which can be jointly trained end-to-end using an efficient training strategy. We investigate the proposed training-strategy and compare our method to other well-known reconstruction techniques with learned and non-learned regularization methods. Results: Our proposed method outperforms all other methods based on non-learned regularization. Further, it performs similar or better than a CNN-based method employing a 3D U-Net and a method using adaptive dictionary learning. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that even by training the network with only iteration, it is possible to increase the length of the network at test time and further improve the results. Conclusions: End-to-end training allows to highly reduce the number of trainable parameters of and stabilize the reconstruction network. Further, because it is possible to change the length of the network at test time, the need to find a compromise between the complexity of the CNN-block and the number of iterations in each CG-block becomes irrelevant.", "Large Paragraph Index": 0, "Source": "arxiv", "Substitutes": []}, {"ID": 52, "Title": "Monotone additive statistics", "URL": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00618", "Text": "We study statistics: mappings from distributions to real numbers.

The amount of displacement in the radial plane is proportional to the strength of a stray electric field. Therefore, we evaluated the micromotion compensation condition by measuring the ion displacements from the ion equilibrium position using two different radial trap frequencies with various combinations of the compensation voltage. The residual electric field uncertainty of this technique reached a few volts per meter. This compensation technique does not depend on the orientation of the incident cooling laser or the detuning and imaging direction. Therefore, this method is suitable for a planar ion trap, a stylus ion trap, which limits the propagation angle of lasers, or miniaturized ion trap systems for sensing and metrological applications.", "Large Paragraph Index": 0, "Source": "arxiv", "Substitutes": []}, {"ID": 54, "Title": "Few-shot Learning for CT Scan based COVID-19 Diagnosis", "URL": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00596", "Text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern infecting more than 40 million people across 188 countries and territories. Chest computed tomography (CT) imaging technique benefits from its high diagnostic accuracy and robustness, it has become an indispensable way for COVID-19 mass testing. Recently, deep learning approaches have become an effective tool for automatic screening of medical images, and it is also being considered for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the high infection risk involved with COVID-19 leads to relative sparseness of collected labeled data limiting the performance of such methodologies. Moreover, accurately labeling CT images require expertise of radiologists making the process expensive and time-consuming. In order to tackle the above issues, we propose a supervised domain adaption based COVID-19 CT diagnostic method which can perform effectively when only a small samples of labeled CT scans are available. To compensate for the sparseness of labeled data, the proposed method utilizes a large amount of synthetic COVID-19 CT images and adjusts the networks from the source domain (synthetic data) to the target domain (real data) with a cross-domain training mechanism.

Specifically, we firstly represent such dynamic environments as graph-structured data and propose an effective strategy for edge definition to aggregate surrounding information for the ego-vehicle. Then graph convolutional neural networks are used as the perception module to capture global and geometric features from the environment. To generate safe and efficient navigation policy, we further incorporate it with conditional imitation learning algorithm, to learn driving behaviors directly from expert demonstrations. Our proposed network is capable of handling a varying number of surrounding vehicles and generating optimal control actions (e.g., steering angle and throttle) according to the given high-level commands (e.g., turn left towards the global goal).

We first identify how the ground plane provides additional clues in depth reasoning in 3D detection in driving scenes. Based on this observation, we then improve the processing of 3D anchors and introduce a novel neural network module to fully utilize such application-specific priors in the framework of deep learning.
