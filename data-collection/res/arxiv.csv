Measurement of ion displacement via RF power variation for excess micromotion compensation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00788,"We demonstrate a method of micromotion minimization of a trapped ion in a linear Paul trap based on the precision measurement of the ion trapping position displacement due to a stray electric field in the radial plane by ion fluorescence imaging. The amount of displacement in the radial plane is proportional to the strength of a stray electric field. Therefore, we evaluated the micromotion compensation condition by measuring the ion displacements from the ion equilibrium position using two different radial trap frequencies with various combinations of the compensation voltage. The residual electric field uncertainty of this technique reached a few volts per meter. This compensation technique does not depend on the orientation of the incident cooling laser or the detuning and imaging direction. Therefore, this method is suitable for a planar ion trap, a stylus ion trap, which limits the propagation angle of lasers, or miniaturized ion trap systems for sensing and metrological applications."
An End-To-End-Trainable Iterative Network Architecture for Accelerated Radial Multi-Coil 2D Cine MR Image Reconstruction,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00783,"Iterative Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which resemble unrolled learned iterative schemes have shown to consistently deliver state-of-the-art results for image reconstruction problems across different imaging modalities. However, because these methodes include the forward model in the architecture, their applicability is often restricted to either relatively small reconstruction problems or to problems with operators which are computationally cheap to compute. As a consequence, they have so far not been applied to dynamic non-Cartesian multi-coil reconstruction problems. Methods: In this work, we propose a CNN-architecture for image reconstruction of accelerated 2D radial cine MRI with multiple receiver coils. The network is based on a computationally light CNN-component and a subsequent conjugate gradient (CG) method which can be jointly trained end-to-end using an efficient training strategy. We investigate the proposed training-strategy and compare our method to other well-known reconstruction techniques with learned and non-learned regularization methods. Results: Our proposed method outperforms all other methods based on non-learned regularization. Further, it performs similar or better than a CNN-based method employing a 3D U-Net and a method using adaptive dictionary learning. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that even by training the network with only iteration, it is possible to increase the length of the network at test time and further improve the results. Conclusions: End-to-end training allows to highly reduce the number of trainable parameters of and stabilize the reconstruction network. Further, because it is possible to change the length of the network at test time, the need to find a compromise between the complexity of the CNN-block and the number of iterations in each CG-block becomes irrelevant."
Many Hands Make Light Work: Using Essay Traits to Automatically Score Essays,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00781,"Most research in the area of automatic essay grading (AEG) is geared towards scoring the essay holistically while there has also been some work done on scoring individual essay traits. In this paper, we describe a way to score essays holistically using a multi-task learning (MTL) approach, where scoring the essay holistically is the primary task, and scoring the essay traits is the auxiliary task. We compare our results with a single-task learning (STL) approach, using both LSTMs and BiLSTMs. We also compare our results of the auxiliary task with such tasks done in other AEG systems. To find out which traits work best for different types of essays, we conduct ablation tests for each of the essay traits. We also report the runtime and number of training parameters for each system. We find that MTL-based BiLSTM system gives the best results for scoring the essay holistically, as well as performing well on scoring the essay traits."
Spiral structures in gravito-turbulent gaseous disks,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00775,"Gravitational instabilities can drive small-scale turbulence and large-scale spiral arms in massive gaseous disks under conditions of slow radiative cooling. These motions affect the observed disk morphology, its mass accretion rate and variability, and could control the process of planet formation via dust grain concentration, processing and collisional fragmentation. We study gravito-turbulence and the associated spiral structures in thin gaseous disks subject to a prescribed cooling law. We characterize the morphology, coherence and propagation of the spirals, looking out for departures from viscous disk models. We use the finite-volume code Pluto to integrate the equations of self-gravitating hydrodynamics in three-dimensional spherical geometry. The gas is cooled over longer-than-orbital timescales to trigger the gravitational instability and sustain turbulence. We ran models for various disk masses and cooling rates. In all cases considered, the turbulent gravitational stress transports angular momentum outward at a rate compatible with viscous disk theory. The dissipation of orbital energy happens via shocks in spiral density wakes, heating the disk back to a marginally stable thermal equilibrium. These wakes drive vertical motions and contribute to mix material from the disk with its corona. They are formed and destroyed intermittently, and they nearly corotate with the gas at every radius. As a consequence, large-scale spiral arms exhibit no long-term global coherence and energy thermalization is an essentially local process. In the absence of radial substructures or tidal forcing, and provided with a local cooling law, gravito-turbulence reduces to a local phenomenon in thin gaseous disks."
Joint Beamforming and Phase Optimization in a Multi-user Communication System Composed of Dual Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00767,"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has becoming a useful tool in future wireless communication systems for close-distance communication network. This paper we use Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) for downlink multi-user communication designed to improve energy collection performance while satisfying wireless information and Power Transfer (WIPT). The designed system consists of an IRS-assisted system consists of a multi-antenna assisted base station (BS) and two opposite multi-antenna assisted information receiver cooperated (RIS) as energy receiver (ERs) that meets energy collection requirements. Based on the electromagnetic property of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), like two mirrors that are opposite each other, setting two Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) attached to the city buildings to reflect the sending signals. The transmitting precoding of the Multi-antenna Auxiliary Base Station (BS) and the angular phase transfer matrix of the multi-antenna Auxiliary Information Receiver (IRs) need to be optimized together to maximize the energy harvesting of IoT devices for energy efficiency (EE) of the IRs system and to provide users with the efficiency of the received signal. In order to solve the joint optimization problem effectively, we turn the non-convex maximize problem into the equivalent formal error method based on the mean square, and finally use the iterative algorithm for optimization. As for algorithm, we respectively use MSE method, semidefinite relaxation techniques to simplify transmitting beamforming matrix and the matrix phase shift. Through the observation of simulation data, it can be concluded that the performance optimization method of SDR based on RIS is effective."
Bosonic Indistinguishability-Dependent Contextuality,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00746,"We uncover a form of quantum contextuality that connects maximal contextuality to boson indistinguihability in a similar way maximal nonlocality with respect to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality is connected to maximal entanglement. Unlike previous forms of photonic contextuality, this form cannot be simulated with classical light, as it relies on indistinguishability and higher-order interference. Ideal measurements on the bosonic system can be performed by means of dispersive coupling with an ancillary qubit. This allows us delaying at will the ending of each measurement and targeting high-dimensional contextual correlations, which are features which cannot be achieved with existing platforms. "
Fusion of conformal defects in four dimensions,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00718,"We consider two conformal defects close to each other in a free theory, and study what happens as the distance between them goes to zero. This limit is the same as zooming out, and the two defects have fused to another defect. As we zoom in we find a non-conformal effective action for the fused defect. Among other things this means that we cannot in general decompose the two-point correlator of two defects in terms of other conformal defects. We prove the fusion using the path integral formalism by treating the defects as sources for a scalar in the bulk."
Real-time Hall-effect detection of current-induced magnetization dynamics in ferrimagnets,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00716,"Measurements of the transverse Hall resistance are widely used to investigate electron transport, magnetization phenomena, and topological quantum states. Owing to the difficulty of probing transient changes of the transverse resistance, the vast majority of Hall effect experiments are carried out in stationary conditions using either dc or ac currents. Here we present an approach to perform time-resolved measurements of the transient Hall resistance during current-pulse injection with sub-nanosecond temporal resolution. We apply this technique to investigate in real-time the magnetization reversal caused by spin-orbit torques in ferrimagnetic GdFeCo dots. Single-shot Hall effect measurements show that the current-induced switching of GdFeCo is widely distributed in time and characterized by significant activation delays, which limit the total switching speed despite the high domain-wall velocity typical of ferrimagnets. Our method applies to a broad range of current-induced phenomena and can be combined with non-electrical excitations to perform pump-probe Hall effect measurements. "
Ground-aware Monocular 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Driving,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00690,"Estimating the 3D position and orientation of objects in the environment with a single RGB camera is a critical and challenging task for low-cost urban autonomous driving and mobile robots. Most of the existing algorithms are based on the geometric constraints in 2D-3D correspondence, which stems from generic 6D object pose estimation. We first identify how the ground plane provides additional clues in depth reasoning in 3D detection in driving scenes. Based on this observation, we then improve the processing of 3D anchors and introduce a novel neural network module to fully utilize such application-specific priors in the framework of deep learning. Finally, we introduce an efficient neural network embedded with the proposed module for 3D object detection. We further verify the power of the proposed module with a neural network designed for monocular depth prediction. The two proposed networks achieve state-of-the-art performances on the KITTI 3D object detection and depth prediction benchmarks, respectively."
Autonomous Navigation through intersections with Graph ConvolutionalNetworks and Conditional Imitation Learning for Self-driving Cars,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00675,"In autonomous driving, navigation through unsignaled intersections with many traffic participants moving around is a challenging task. To provide a solution to this problem, we propose a novel branched network G-CIL for the navigation policy learning. Specifically, we firstly represent such dynamic environments as graph-structured data and propose an effective strategy for edge definition to aggregate surrounding information for the ego-vehicle. Then graph convolutional neural networks are used as the perception module to capture global and geometric features from the environment. To generate safe and efficient navigation policy, we further incorporate it with conditional imitation learning algorithm, to learn driving behaviors directly from expert demonstrations. Our proposed network is capable of handling a varying number of surrounding vehicles and generating optimal control actions (e.g., steering angle and throttle) according to the given high-level commands (e.g., turn left towards the global goal). Evaluations on unsignaled intersections with various traffic densities demonstrate that our end-to-end trainable neural network outperforms the baselines with higher success rate and shorter navigation time."
Over-the-Air Computation with Spatial-and-Temporal Correlated Signals,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00664,"Over-the-air computation (AirComp) leveraging the superposition property of wireless multiple-access channel (MAC), is a promising technique for effective data collection and computation of large-scale wireless sensor measurements in Internet of Things applications. Most existing work on AirComp only considered computation of spatial-and-temporal independent sensor signals, though in practice different sensor measurement signals are usually correlated. In this letter, we propose an AirComp system with spatial-and-temporal correlated sensor signals, and formulate the optimal AirComp policy design problem for achieving the minimum computation mean-squared error (MSE). We develop the optimal AirComp policy with the minimum computation MSE in each time step by utilizing the current and the previously received signals. We also propose and optimize a low-complexity AirComp policy in closed form with the performance approaching to the optimal policy."
Finite Codimensionality Method in Infinite-dimensional Optimization Problems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00652,"This paper is devoted to establishing a first order necessary condition of Fritz John type for nonlinear infinite-dimensional optimization problems. Different from the known constraint qualifications in the optimization theory, a finite codimensionality condition is introduced. It is equivalent to suitable a priori estimates, which are much easier to be verified. As applications, the first order necessary conditions for optimal control problems of some deterministic/stochastic control systems are derived in a uniform way. "
"Long-term, orbital, and rapid variations of the Be star V923 Aql = HD 183656",https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00631,"We present the latest results of a long-term observational project aimed at observing, collecting from the literature, and homogenising the light, colour, and spectral variations of the well-known emission-line Be star V923 Aql. Our analysis of these parameters confirms that all of the observables exhibit cyclic changes with variable cycle length between about 1800 and 3000 days, so far documented for seven consecutive cycles. We show that these variations can be qualitatively understood within the framework of the model of one-armed oscillation of the circumstellar disk, with a wave of increased density and prograde revolution in space. We confirm the binary nature of the object with a 214.716 day period and estimate the probable system properties. We also confirm the presence of rapid light, and likely also spectral changes. However, we cannot provide any firm conclusions regarding their nature. A quantitative modelling study of long-term changes is planned as a follow-up to this work."
Monotone additive statistics,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00618,"We study statistics: mappings from distributions to real numbers. We characterize all statistics that are monotone with respect to first-order stochastic dominance, and additive for sums of independent random variables. We explore a number of applications, including a representation of stationary, monotone time preferences, generalizing Fishburn and Rubinstein (1982) to time lotteries."
Few-shot Learning for CT Scan based COVID-19 Diagnosis,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00596,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern infecting more than 40 million people across 188 countries and territories. Chest computed tomography (CT) imaging technique benefits from its high diagnostic accuracy and robustness, it has become an indispensable way for COVID-19 mass testing. Recently, deep learning approaches have become an effective tool for automatic screening of medical images, and it is also being considered for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the high infection risk involved with COVID-19 leads to relative sparseness of collected labeled data limiting the performance of such methodologies. Moreover, accurately labeling CT images require expertise of radiologists making the process expensive and time-consuming. In order to tackle the above issues, we propose a supervised domain adaption based COVID-19 CT diagnostic method which can perform effectively when only a small samples of labeled CT scans are available. To compensate for the sparseness of labeled data, the proposed method utilizes a large amount of synthetic COVID-19 CT images and adjusts the networks from the source domain (synthetic data) to the target domain (real data) with a cross-domain training mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot COVID-19 CT imaging based diagnostic tasks. "
