10685,Palace of Versailles,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles,"French palace on the outskirts of Paris
For the extensive park around the palace, see Gardens of Versailles
The Palace of Versailles ( vair-SY, vur-SY; French: Château de Versailles  ()) was the principal royal residence of France from 1682, under Louis XIV, until the start of the French Revolution in 1789, under Louis XVI. It is located in the department of Yvelines, in the region of Île-de-France, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) southwest of the centre of Paris.
A simple hunting lodging and later a small château with a moat occupied the site until 1661, when the first work expanding the château into a palace was carried out for Louis XIV. In 1682, when the palace had become large enough, the king moved the entire royal court and the French government to Versailles. Some of the palace furniture at this time was constructed of solid silver, but in 1689 much of it was melted down to pay for the cost of war. Subsequent rulers mostly carried out interior remodeling, to meet the demands of changing taste, although Louis XV did install an opera house at the north end of the north wing for the wedding of the Dauphin and Marie Antoinette in 1770. The palace has also been a site of historical importance. The Peace of Paris (1783) was signed at Versailles, the Proclamation of the German Empire occurred in the vaunted Hall of Mirrors, and World War I was ended in the palace with the Treaty of Versailles, among many other events.
The palace is now a historical monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, notable especially for the ceremonial Hall of Mirrors, the jewel-like Royal Opera, and the royal apartments; for the more intimate royal residences, the Grand Trianon and Petit Trianon located within the park; the small rustic Hameau (Hamlet) created for Marie Antoinette; and the vast Gardens of Versailles with fountains, canals, and geometric flower beds and groves, laid out by André le Nôtre. The Palace was stripped of all its furnishings after the French Revolution, but many pieces have been returned and many of the palace rooms have been restored.
In 2017 the Palace of Versailles received 7,700,000 visitors, making it the second-most visited monument in the Île-de-France region, just behind the Louvre and ahead of the Eiffel Tower.

3858,Angelina Jolie,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie,"""I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."" —Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy
After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[232] Jolie further wrote, ""On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.""
Jolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing. Her decision was met with praise from various public figures, while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women. Dubbed ""The Angelina Effect"" by a Time cover story, Jolie's influence led to a ""global and long-lasting"" increase in BRCA gene testing: the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[240] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[243] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk. In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs, which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[247]",1,wikipedia
18028,Augustus,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus,"Augustus was granted sole imperium within the city of Rome itself, in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular ""imperium"" when they crossed the Pomerium – the sacred boundary of Rome – and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, when he was in the city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or auctoritas, his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.
In addition, the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time, because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the legatus who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus's proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph, a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. Lucius Cornelius Balbus was the last man outside Augustus's family to receive this award, in 19 BC. Tiberius, Augustus's eldest stepson by Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph—for victories in Germania in 7 BC.",1,wikipedia
4368,Jennifer Aniston,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston,"Aniston appeared as the former wife of a bounty hunter (Gerard Butler) in the romantic comedy action film The Bounty Hunter (2010). The film was panned by critics, with The Hollywood Reporter writing that ""the mishmash ends up as a thoroughly unfunny adult cartoon."" Nevertheless, it was a box office success, garnering over $130 million worldwide. A lukewarm box office reception greeted her next film, the romantic comedy The Switch (2010), in which she starred with Jason Bateman as a 30-something single woman who decides to have a child using a sperm bank. The film's opening weekend drew what The Hollywood Reporter dubbed ""a dispiriting $8.4 million"". The film received generally mixed reviews, with review site Metacritic showing 13 out of 30 critics delivering a positive verdict.
In 2010, Aniston was also a guest star on the season two premiere of ABC's sitcom Cougar Town, playing a psychiatrist. Her announcement that she would appear on Cougar Town garnered excitement and was dubbed her return to television. The A.V. Club wrote, "" is a funny bit, and it highlights just how much Jennifer Aniston is built to be a TV star.""[67] In 2011, she starred opposite Adam Sandler as an office manager posing as the wife of a plastic surgeon in the romantic comedy Just Go with It,[70] and played a sexually aggressive dentist in Horrible Bosses. Just Go with It and Horrible Bosses both made over $100 million in North America and $200 million worldwide.[74]",1,wikipedia
6468,Italy,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy,"Economy
Italy has a major advanced capitalist mixed economy, ranking as the third-largest in the Eurozone and the eighth-largest in the world. A founding member of the G7, the Eurozone and the OECD, it is regarded as one of the world's most industrialised nations and a leading country in world trade and exports.[231] It is a highly developed country, with the world's 8th highest quality of life in 2005 and the 26th Human Development Index. The country is well known for its creative and innovative business, a large and competitive agricultural sector (with the world's largest wine production), and for its influential and high-quality automobile, machinery, food, design and fashion industry.[237]
Italy is the world's sixth largest manufacturing country, characterised by a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size and many dynamic small and medium-sized enterprises, notoriously clustered in several industrial districts, which are the backbone of the Italian industry. This has produced a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of niche market and luxury products, that if on one side is less capable to compete on the quantity, on the other side is more capable of facing the competition from China and other emerging Asian economies based on lower labour costs, with higher quality products. Italy was the world's 7th largest exporter in 2016. Its closest trade ties are with the other countries of the European Union, with whom it conducts about 59% of its total trade. Its largest EU trade partners, in order of market share, are Germany (12.9%), France (11.4%), and Spain (7.4%).
The automotive industry is a significant part of the Italian manufacturing sector, with over 144,000 firms and almost 485,000 employed people in 2015, and a contribution of 8.5% to Italian GDP. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles or FCA is currently the world's seventh-largest auto maker. The country boasts a wide range of acclaimed products, from very compact city cars to luxury supercars such as Maserati, Lamborghini, and Ferrari, which was rated the world's most powerful brand by Brand Finance.",2,wikipedia
22632,The Slim Shady LP,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Slim_Shady_LP,"The Slim Shady LP (stylized as THE SLim Shady LP) is the second studio album and the major-label debut by American rapper Eminem, released on February 23, 1999 by Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan, following Eminem's recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself.
Featuring West Coast hip hop, G-funk and horrorcore musical styles, the majority of The Slim Shady LP's lyrical content is written from the perspective of Eminem's alter ego Slim Shady, whom he created on the Slim Shady EP (1997). The Slim Shady LP contains cartoonish depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity, which Eminem referred to as ""made-up tales of trailer-park stuff,"" describing it as horror film-esque, in that it is solely for entertainment value. Although many of the lyrics on the album are considered to be satirical, Eminem also depicts his frustrations of living in poverty.
The Slim Shady LP debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, just below TLC's FanMail, and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It received commercial and critical success, with critics praising Eminem for his unique lyrical style, dark humor lyrics, and eccentric personality. The first single, ""My Name Is"", became Eminem's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won Best Rap Album at 2000 Grammy Awards, while ""My Name Is"" won Best Rap Solo Performance. In 2000, The Slim Shady LP was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
While The Slim Shady LP's success turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity, he became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on U.S. youth. Despite this, the album's success was vital in breaking the stereotype that ""white people cannot rap"", and has since been included in several publications' lists of the greatest albums of all time. Spin later included it in their list of ""The 300 Best Albums of 1985–2014"".",2,wikipedia
25176,History of India,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_India,"Around c. 300 BCE – c. 200 CE, Pathupattu, an anthology of ten mid-length books collection, which is considered part of Sangam Literature, were composed; the composition of eight anthologies of poetic works Ettuthogai as well as the composition of eighteen minor poetic works Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku; while Tolkāppiyam, the earliest grammarian work in the Tamil language was developed. Also, during Sangam period, two of the Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature were composed. Ilango Adigal composed Silappatikaram, which is a non-religious work, that revolves around Kannagi, who having lost her husband to a miscarriage of justice at the court of the Pandyan dynasty, wreaks her revenge on his kingdom, and Manimekalai, composed by Sīthalai Sāttanār, is a sequel to Silappatikaram, and tells the story of the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi, who became a Buddhist Bikkuni.[124]
Classical and early medieval periods (c. 200 BCE – c. 1200 CE)
The time between the Maurya Empire in the 3rd century BCE and the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE is referred to as the ""Classical"" period of India. It can be divided in various sub-periods, depending on the chosen periodisation. Classical period begins after the decline of the Maurya Empire, and the corresponding rise of the Shunga dynasty and Satavahana dynasty. The Gupta Empire (4th–6th century) is regarded as the ""Golden Age"" of Hinduism, although a host of kingdoms ruled over India in these centuries. Also, the Sangam literature flourished from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE in southern India. During this period, India's economy is estimated to have been the largest in the world, having between one-third and one-quarter of the world's wealth, from 1 CE to 1000 CE.[129]

8688,Barcelona,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona,"While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report, the city is ""overrun  hordes of tourists"". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included ""Tourists go home"", ""Barcelona is not for sale"" and ""We will not be driven out"". By then, number of visitors had increased from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62 million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated €30 billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.
A May 2017 article in England's The Telegraph newspaper included Barcelona among the Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, ""We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop "". To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb with a €30,000. The mayor has suggested an additional tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors. One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an ""overtourism crisis"" in several major European cities. ""Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success."", he said. ""Managing tourism more responsibly can help"", Francis later told a journalist, ""but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that"".

9655,Large Hadron Collider,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider,"On 13 December 2011, CERN reported that the Standard Model Higgs boson, if it exists, is most likely to have a mass constrained to the range 115–130 GeV. Both the CMS and ATLAS detectors have also shown intensity peaks in the 124–125 GeV range, consistent with either background noise or the observation of the Higgs boson.
On 22 December 2011, it was reported that a new composite particle had been observed, the χ b (3P) bottomonium state.
On 4 July 2012, both the CMS and ATLAS teams announced the discovery of a boson in the mass region around 125–126 GeV, with a statistical significance at the level of 5 sigma each. This meets the formal level required to announce a new particle. The observed properties were consistent with the Higgs boson, but scientists were cautious as to whether it is formally identified as actually being the Higgs boson, pending further analysis. On 14 March 2013, CERN announced confirmation that the observed particle was indeed the predicted Higgs Boson.
On 8 November 2012, the LHCb team reported on an experiment seen as a ""golden"" test of supersymmetry theories in physics, by measuring the very rare decay of the B s {\displaystyle B_{s}} meson into two muons ( B s 0 → μ + μ − {\displaystyle B_{s}^{0}\rightarrow \mu ^{+}\mu ^{-}} ). The results, which match those predicted by the non-supersymmetrical Standard Model rather than the predictions of many branches of supersymmetry, show the decays are less common than some forms of supersymmetry predict, though could still match the predictions of other versions of supersymmetry theory. The results as initially drafted are stated to be short of proof but at a relatively high 3.5 sigma level of significance. The result was later confirmed by the CMS collaboration.",2,wikipedia

Additionally, several local network television channels such as Dubai One (formerly Channel 33), and Dubai TV (EDTV) provide programming in English and Arabic respectively. Dubai is also the headquarters for several print media outlets. Dar Al Khaleej, Al Bayan and Al Ittihad are the city's largest circulating Arabic language newspapers, while Gulf News, Khaleej Times, Khaleej Mag and 7days are the largest circulating English newspapers.
Etisalat, the government-owned telecommunications provider, held a virtual monopoly over telecommunication services in Dubai prior to the establishment of other, smaller telecommunications companies such as Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC—better known as Du) in 2006. Internet was introduced into the UAE (and therefore Dubai) in 1995. The network has an Internet bandwidth of 7.5 Gbit/s with capacity of 49 STM1 links. Dubai houses two of four Domain Name System (DNS) data centres in the country (DXBNIC1, DXBNIC2). Censorship is common in Dubai and used by the government to control content that it believes violates the cultural and political sensitivities of Emirates. Homosexuality, drugs, and the theory of evolution are generally considered taboo.[258]",1,wikipedia

However, the ""Pilot"" episode was filmed at CBS Radford. The laugh track was later created by recording an audience being shown the final edited episode. Thomas claimed that shooting before a live audience would have been impossible because of the structure of the show and the numerous flashforwards in each episode and because doing so ""would blur the line between 'audience' and 'hostage situation'"". Later seasons started filming in front of an audience on occasion, when smaller sets were used.
The theme song is a portion of ""Hey Beautiful"" by The Solids, of which Bays and Thomas are members. Episodes from season 1 generally started with the opening credits. A cold opening has been used since season 2. Viewers then occasionally see Ted's children on a couch and hear him talking to them, telling the story of how he met their mother. Alternatively, scenes from previous episodes or shots of New York City with Ted narrating over the top are shown. Thomas has stated that Future Ted is an unreliable narrator, since he is trying to tell a story that happened over 20 years earlier; this has been a plot point in several episodes including ""The Goat"", ""Oh Honey"", ""How I Met Everyone Else"", and ""The Mermaid Theory"". Nevertheless, Thomas has also emphasized maintaining a coherent and consistent universe and trying to avoid continuity errors, a problem he noticed in other shows.",1,wikipedia

The thing about Fark is - it's a great site, but it's all based on these threads. Someone submits a link, and that gives you a thread to talk about it. After something like 30 days, posting is cut off. Also, the site is made up of a lot of links for the public threads, but many times that for the private threads. It can be very hard to keep up with a single thread. So I realized that if this meme were to take off - it needed a home.

EW: If you look at the successes of this year, we have won more non-discrimination measures, we have won more protections for transgender people, we have won more—or at least as many—gains for youth protection this year than any other year in our movement. All of it fueled by and accelerated by the marriage work and the discussions it engenders about gay people and our common humanity. That helps move the benchmarks about what is fair. Richard Kim and some of the others--not all--but some of the others have a false choice framing that continually undermines the common effort. Many of the goals that they support I also support. That said, I don’t think they speak for everybody that signed that statement, and the proof is that it went out there and went nowhere. Meanwhile, those of us who feel differently continue to move forward and rack gains for the movement, including, for example, the win in Iowa just a few weeks ago.

My father was a holocaust survivor and my mother’s father was a protester during World War I when he came to this country as an immigrant, and he was literally spat upon for not going to fight in the war. His official sentence for being a conscientious objector was to be forced to stand against the courthouse in Hudson County, New Jersey so that passers-by could spit on him.
DS: What were you taught about him?
NS: I knew him as a kid and he told me these stories, and my mother told me, and it was very upsetting to me, but very inspiring to think about trying to rectify injustices. When I say my own family, my own personal experiences are so trivial compared to those, but having teachers not allow different viewpoints come out in class and seeing kids tormenting other kids that were different. When I got a little bit older there was an experience with a teacher who was exposing students to different viewpoints about the Vietnam War, and there was a call for him to be fired and he was editorialized against; I led a campaign to defend his free speech rights, and our free speech rights. Once I had the idea that I could go to law school to get professional skills to advocate for values that I had always believed in, it just seemed the right thing to do. There are many other paths, I realize, but it certainly has been a good path to try to work with the values I care deeply about that I have had throughout my whole life.

But I didn't want to play chess because I didn't have options. That is a big thing for me: I wanted to have gone to college and have a degree and see if I want to pursue a career out of chess or to choose chess. So I wanted to have that choice. So I was looking into going to universities in US anyways, and before I did my SATs, I talked to two different universities: Saint Louis University [SLU] and UTT [University of Texas at Tyler]. And they both offered very great scholarships. And the one factor that I, kind of like made my decision was the summer housing. Because I wouldn't have anywhere to go and live. I don't have the luxury of going back to my family for a summer. And I just hated the idea of every summer having to find a friend and just like being living with someone for three months. So SLU offered to cover the summer housing and I would be on campus dorms — apartments — and that was the big decisive factor for me.

Melody Thomas Scott: Whenever an actor gets a job on a soap, they never know how long it will last.

Three years go by, then another three or another five, and if you are lucky, you eventually find yourself in double digits!

The Kallis report was never made public. Helios, which was renamed Ajet Airways, closed down in 2006. Helios and Boeing were sued by victims' relatives; they sought €76 million but reached a settlement for an undisclosed sum. The accident report had also blamed Boeing for an ""ineffectiveness of measures"" over the dual-purpose alarm system.
The five defendants were charged in 2008. The defunct airline and four senior staff members each faced 119 counts of manslaughter, and alternative counts of causing death by a reckless, thoughtless or dangerous act. This gave a total of 1,190 charges. Manslaughter carries a potential life sentence with up to four years available on the lesser charge. ""The charges concern two of the three most serious offences under the Cyprus penal code,"" deputy attorney general Akis Papasavvas said at the time.
The prosecution case was that the pilots were unfit to fly and the defendants were negligent in letting them at the controls.

Background
((William S. Saturn )) What are some of your achievements in your business career?
Rocky De La Fuente: From my perspective, my greatest achievements in business are tied to the people and families I have helped. I've had the good fortune to create dozens of business that created thousands of jobs across the United States as well as in other countries. I always paid a fair wage, provided access to healthcare, and tried to create opportunities for advancement for those who demonstrated the desire to improve their lot in life.
Aerial view of De La Fuente's hometown San Diego. If you're asking for a more traditional answer with respect to what I have personally done, at the age of twenty, I got a job selling automobiles. Less than two years later, I became the General Manager of a dealership. Two years after that, I acquired my first dealership and, over the next 16 years, I added 27 more dealerships to my portfolio. And at the age of 28, I was honored to be elected by my peers in that industry as Chairman of the National Dealer Council for the third largest Automotive Company in the world at the time.
In between, in an effort to help Mexico during the financial crisis that arose there in 1982, I opened 11 currency exchanges to facilitate free-flowing trade between Mexico and the United States. The network included seven offices in California and four in Texas. Then, over the next five years, I founded three U.S. banks; one being a National Bank approved by the OCC FDIC
Some of my efforts were recently recognized when I was awarded an Honorary Doctorate as an ""International Corporate Ambassador"" by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization

These motions affect the observed disk morphology, its mass accretion rate and variability, and could control the process of planet formation via dust grain concentration, processing and collisional fragmentation. We study gravito-turbulence and the associated spiral structures in thin gaseous disks subject to a prescribed cooling law. We characterize the morphology, coherence and propagation of the spirals, looking out for departures from viscous disk models. We use the finite-volume code Pluto to integrate the equations of self-gravitating hydrodynamics in three-dimensional spherical geometry. The gas is cooled over longer-than-orbital timescales to trigger the gravitational instability and sustain turbulence. We ran models for various disk masses and cooling rates. In all cases considered, the turbulent gravitational stress transports angular momentum outward at a rate compatible with viscous disk theory. The dissipation of orbital energy happens via shocks in spiral density wakes, heating the disk back to a marginally stable thermal equilibrium. These wakes drive vertical motions and contribute to mix material from the disk with its corona. They are formed and destroyed intermittently, and they nearly corotate with the gas at every radius. As a consequence, large-scale spiral arms exhibit no long-term global coherence and energy thermalization is an essentially local process. In the absence of radial substructures or tidal forcing, and provided with a local cooling law, gravito-turbulence reduces to a local phenomenon in thin gaseous disks.",0,arxiv

Owing to the difficulty of probing transient changes of the transverse resistance, the vast majority of Hall effect experiments are carried out in stationary conditions using either dc or ac currents. Here we present an approach to perform time-resolved measurements of the transient Hall resistance during current-pulse injection with sub-nanosecond temporal resolution. We apply this technique to investigate in real-time the magnetization reversal caused by spin-orbit torques in ferrimagnetic GdFeCo dots. Single-shot Hall effect measurements show that the current-induced switching of GdFeCo is widely distributed in time and characterized by significant activation delays, which limit the total switching speed despite the high domain-wall velocity typical of ferrimagnets. Our method applies to a broad range of current-induced phenomena and can be combined with non-electrical excitations to perform pump-probe Hall effect measurements. ",0,arxiv
27440,Fusion of conformal defects in four dimensions,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00718,"We consider two conformal defects close to each other in a free theory, and study what happens as the distance between them goes to zero. This limit is the same as zooming out, and the two defects have fused to another defect. As we zoom in we find a non-conformal effective action for the fused defect. Among other things this means that we cannot in general decompose the two-point correlator of two defects in terms of other conformal defects. We prove the fusion using the path integral formalism by treating the defects as sources for a scalar in the bulk.",0,arxiv
27436,Many Hands Make Light Work: Using Essay Traits to Automatically Score Essays,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00781,"Most research in the area of automatic essay grading (AEG) is geared towards scoring the essay holistically while there has also been some work done on scoring individual essay traits. In this paper, we describe a way to score essays holistically using a multi-task learning (MTL) approach, where scoring the essay holistically is the primary task, and scoring the essay traits is the auxiliary task. We compare our results with a single-task learning (STL) approach, using both LSTMs and BiLSTMs. We also compare our results of the auxiliary task with such tasks done in other AEG systems. To find out which traits work best for different types of essays, we conduct ablation tests for each of the essay traits. We also report the runtime and number of training parameters for each system. We find that MTL-based BiLSTM system gives the best results for scoring the essay holistically, as well as performing well on scoring the essay traits.",0,arxiv
27444,Over-the-Air Computation with Spatial-and-Temporal Correlated Signals,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00664,"Over-the-air computation (AirComp) leveraging the superposition property of wireless multiple-access channel (MAC), is a promising technique for effective data collection and computation of large-scale wireless sensor measurements in Internet of Things applications. Most existing work on AirComp only considered computation of spatial-and-temporal independent sensor signals, though in practice different sensor measurement signals are usually correlated. In this letter, we propose an AirComp system with spatial-and-temporal correlated sensor signals, and formulate the optimal AirComp policy design problem for achieving the minimum computation mean-squared error (MSE). We develop the optimal AirComp policy with the minimum computation MSE in each time step by utilizing the current and the previously received signals. We also propose and optimize a low-complexity AirComp policy in closed form with the performance approaching to the optimal policy.",0,arxiv
27438,Joint Beamforming and Phase Optimization in a Multi-user Communication System Composed of Dual Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00767,"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has becoming a useful tool in future wireless communication systems for close-distance communication network. This paper we use Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) for downlink multi-user communication designed to improve energy collection performance while satisfying wireless information and Power Transfer (WIPT). The designed system consists of an IRS-assisted system consists of a multi-antenna assisted base station (BS) and two opposite multi-antenna assisted information receiver cooperated (RIS) as energy receiver (ERs) that meets energy collection requirements. Based on the electromagnetic property of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), like two mirrors that are opposite each other, setting two Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) attached to the city buildings to reflect the sending signals. The transmitting precoding of the Multi-antenna Auxiliary Base Station (BS) and the angular phase transfer matrix of the multi-antenna Auxiliary Information Receiver (IRs) need to be optimized together to maximize the energy harvesting of IoT devices for energy efficiency (EE) of the IRs system and to provide users with the efficiency of the received signal. In order to solve the joint optimization problem effectively, we turn the non-convex maximize problem into the equivalent formal error method based on the mean square, and finally use the iterative algorithm for optimization. As for algorithm, we respectively use MSE method, semidefinite relaxation techniques to simplify transmitting beamforming matrix and the matrix phase shift. Through the observation of simulation data, it can be concluded that the performance optimization method of SDR based on RIS is effective.",0,arxiv
27435,An End-To-End-Trainable Iterative Network Architecture for Accelerated Radial Multi-Coil 2D Cine MR Image Reconstruction,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00783,"Iterative Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which resemble unrolled learned iterative schemes have shown to consistently deliver state-of-the-art results for image reconstruction problems across different imaging modalities. However, because these methodes include the forward model in the architecture, their applicability is often restricted to either relatively small reconstruction problems or to problems with operators which are computationally cheap to compute. As a consequence, they have so far not been applied to dynamic non-Cartesian multi-coil reconstruction problems. Methods: In this work, we propose a CNN-architecture for image reconstruction of accelerated 2D radial cine MRI with multiple receiver coils. The network is based on a computationally light CNN-component and a subsequent conjugate gradient (CG) method which can be jointly trained end-to-end using an efficient training strategy. We investigate the proposed training-strategy and compare our method to other well-known reconstruction techniques with learned and non-learned regularization methods. Results: Our proposed method outperforms all other methods based on non-learned regularization. Further, it performs similar or better than a CNN-based method employing a 3D U-Net and a method using adaptive dictionary learning. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that even by training the network with only iteration, it is possible to increase the length of the network at test time and further improve the results. Conclusions: End-to-end training allows to highly reduce the number of trainable parameters of and stabilize the reconstruction network. Further, because it is possible to change the length of the network at test time, the need to find a compromise between the complexity of the CNN-block and the number of iterations in each CG-block becomes irrelevant.",0,arxiv

27434,﻿Measurement of ion displacement via RF power variation for excess micromotion compensation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00788,"We demonstrate a method of micromotion minimization of a trapped ion in a linear Paul trap based on the precision measurement of the ion trapping position displacement due to a stray electric field in the radial plane by ion fluorescence imaging. The amount of displacement in the radial plane is proportional to the strength of a stray electric field. Therefore, we evaluated the micromotion compensation condition by measuring the ion displacements from the ion equilibrium position using two different radial trap frequencies with various combinations of the compensation voltage. The residual electric field uncertainty of this technique reached a few volts per meter. This compensation technique does not depend on the orientation of the incident cooling laser or the detuning and imaging direction. Therefore, this method is suitable for a planar ion trap, a stylus ion trap, which limits the propagation angle of lasers, or miniaturized ion trap systems for sensing and metrological applications.",0,arxiv
27448,Few-shot Learning for CT Scan based COVID-19 Diagnosis,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00596,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern infecting more than 40 million people across 188 countries and territories. Chest computed tomography (CT) imaging technique benefits from its high diagnostic accuracy and robustness, it has become an indispensable way for COVID-19 mass testing. Recently, deep learning approaches have become an effective tool for automatic screening of medical images, and it is also being considered for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the high infection risk involved with COVID-19 leads to relative sparseness of collected labeled data limiting the performance of such methodologies. Moreover, accurately labeling CT images require expertise of radiologists making the process expensive and time-consuming. In order to tackle the above issues, we propose a supervised domain adaption based COVID-19 CT diagnostic method which can perform effectively when only a small samples of labeled CT scans are available. To compensate for the sparseness of labeled data, the proposed method utilizes a large amount of synthetic COVID-19 CT images and adjusts the networks from the source domain (synthetic data) to the target domain (real data) with a cross-domain training mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot COVID-19 CT imaging based diagnostic tasks. ",0,arxiv
27443,Autonomous Navigation through intersections with Graph ConvolutionalNetworks and Conditional Imitation Learning for Self-driving Cars,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00675,"In autonomous driving, navigation through unsignaled intersections with many traffic participants moving around is a challenging task. To provide a solution to this problem, we propose a novel branched network G-CIL for the navigation policy learning. Specifically, we firstly represent such dynamic environments as graph-structured data and propose an effective strategy for edge definition to aggregate surrounding information for the ego-vehicle. Then graph convolutional neural networks are used as the perception module to capture global and geometric features from the environment. To generate safe and efficient navigation policy, we further incorporate it with conditional imitation learning algorithm, to learn driving behaviors directly from expert demonstrations. Our proposed network is capable of handling a varying number of surrounding vehicles and generating optimal control actions (e.g., steering angle and throttle) according to the given high-level commands (e.g., turn left towards the global goal). Evaluations on unsignaled intersections with various traffic densities demonstrate that our end-to-end trainable neural network outperforms the baselines with higher success rate and shorter navigation time.",0,arxiv

Most of the existing algorithms are based on the geometric constraints in 2D-3D correspondence, which stems from generic 6D object pose estimation. We first identify how the ground plane provides additional clues in depth reasoning in 3D detection in driving scenes. Based on this observation, we then improve the processing of 3D anchors and introduce a novel neural network module to fully utilize such application-specific priors in the framework of deep learning. Finally, we introduce an efficient neural network embedded with the proposed module for 3D object detection. We further verify the power of the proposed module with a neural network designed for monocular depth prediction. The two proposed networks achieve state-of-the-art performances on the KITTI 3D object detection and depth prediction benchmarks, respectively.",0,arxiv

Our analysis of these parameters confirms that all of the observables exhibit cyclic changes with variable cycle length between about 1800 and 3000 days, so far documented for seven consecutive cycles. We show that these variations can be qualitatively understood within the framework of the model of one-armed oscillation of the circumstellar disk, with a wave of increased density and prograde revolution in space. We confirm the binary nature of the object with a 214.716 day period and estimate the probable system properties. We also confirm the presence of rapid light, and likely also spectral changes. However, we cannot provide any firm conclusions regarding their nature. A quantitative modelling study of long-term changes is planned as a follow-up to this work.",0,arxiv

Unlike previous forms of photonic contextuality, this form cannot be simulated with classical light, as it relies on indistinguishability and higher-order interference. Ideal measurements on the bosonic system can be performed by means of dispersive coupling with an ancillary qubit. This allows us delaying at will the ending of each measurement and targeting high-dimensional contextual correlations, which are features which cannot be achieved with existing platforms. ",0,arxiv
